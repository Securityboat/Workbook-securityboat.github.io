# Weak Guessable, or Hardcoded Passwords

Weak, Guessable, or Hardcoded Passwords in IoT systems are a critical vulnerability where passwords used to access devices, gateways, or systems are either too simple, predictable, or permanently embedded into the firmware. This makes it easier for attackers to compromise the system by gaining unauthorized access to sensitive data, devices, or entire networks.

## Why Itâ€™s a Problem

#### Weak Passwords: 
Simple passwords like "12345" or "password" are easy to guess using brute force or dictionary attacks. These are often the default passwords set by manufacturers.
#### Guessable Passwords: 
Passwords derived from device details, such as serial numbers or device types, are predictable and can be guessed by attackers with minimal effort.
#### Hardcoded Passwords: 
Passwords embedded into the firmware or software cannot be changed by the user. If attackers discover these (through firmware analysis or leaked documentation), they can exploit them across all devices using the same credentials.

## How It Affects IoT Systems

1. **Devices:** Attackers can remotely control devices by using default or known credentials, potentially compromising their functionality or accessing sensitive data.
2. **Gateways:** Guessable or hardcoded credentials on gateways allow attackers to intercept data or manipulate communication between devices and the cloud.
3. **Cloud Systems and Interfaces:** Weak passwords for cloud dashboards or APIs can lead to full control of the IoT system, resulting in data breaches or operational disruption.

## How to Mitigate This Vulnerability
1. **Enforce Strong Passwords:** Use complex passwords with a mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters.
2. **Unique Default Passwords:** Manufacturers should avoid using the same password for all devices. Devices should generate unique passwords for each unit.
3. **User Password Updates:** Prompt users to change default credentials during the initial setup.
4. **Disable Hardcoded Passwords:** Avoid embedding credentials in firmware. Implement secure authentication mechanisms that allow for password updates.
5. **Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** Add an extra layer of security to make unauthorized access more difficult.
