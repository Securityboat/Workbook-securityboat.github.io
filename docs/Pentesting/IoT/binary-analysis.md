# Binary Analysis

Binary analysis is the process of examining a program or file in its compiled (binary) form to understand its functionality, behavior, and potential security risks. Since binary files are written in machine-readable code that computers execute directly, analysts use specialized tools and techniques to decode and interpret them. This process is commonly applied in software debugging, malware analysis, and reverse engineering tasks.

## Key Techniques in Binary Analysis

1. **Static Analysis:** In this method, the binary is executed in a controlled environment, such as a virtual machine, emulator, or sandbox, to observe its behavior during runtime. Analysts monitor aspects like network communication, memory usage, file system interactions, and system calls to identify vulnerabilities, malware activity, or unexpected behaviors that might only occur when the binary is actively running

2. **Dynamic Analysis:** Here, the binary is executed in a controlled environment, such as a sandbox or emulator, to observe its runtime behavior. Analysts monitor interactions like memory usage, system calls, and network communications to detect anomalies such as unauthorized access or malicious activity.

3. **Fuzzing:** This technique involves bombarding the binary with random or unexpected inputs to see how it reacts. Crashes or unusual behavior can reveal vulnerabilities like memory corruption or improper input handling.

## Tools for Binary Analysis
1. **Binwalk:** For extracting and analyzing binary files, especially firmware.
2. **IDA Pro & Ghidra:** For disassembly and reverse engineering.
3. **Radare2:** An open-source alternative for binary analysis.
