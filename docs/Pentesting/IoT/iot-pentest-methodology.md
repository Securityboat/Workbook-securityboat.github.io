# IoT Pentesting Methodology

IoT pentesting methodology refers to a structured approach for evaluating the security of IoT systems by simulating real-world attacks. The goal is to identify vulnerabilities across devices, gateways, networks, and cloud systems to strengthen their security. The process involves reconnaissance, vulnerability assessment, exploitation, and reporting findings to help secure the IoT environment.

## Steps in IoT Pentesting 

### Reconnaissance

- Gather information about the IoT system, including device types, communication protocols (e.g., MQTT, CoAP, or HTTP), and associated interfaces like mobile apps or APIs.
- Tools like Wireshark can be used to analyze network traffic, and techniques such as scanning for open ports (e.g., with Nmap) help map the system’s architecture.

### Firmware Analysis

- Extract and analyze the firmware from IoT devices.
- **Static Analysis:** Use tools like Binwalk or Ghidra to inspect the firmware for hardcoded credentials, insecure configurations, or cryptographic flaws.
- **Dynamic Analysis:** Emulate the firmware using tools like QEMU to observe runtime behavior, identify vulnerabilities, or detect malware.

### Network Analysis

- Examine communication between devices, gateways, and cloud systems.
- Identify weaknesses like unencrypted data transmission, weak protocols (e.g., HTTP instead of HTTPS), or default credentials in use.
- Simulate attacks like Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) or DoS to test the resilience of the system’s communication layer.

### Interface Testing

- Evaluate user-facing components like web dashboards, mobile apps, or APIs for vulnerabilities.
- Test for weak authentication mechanisms, session management flaws, or injection vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL injection, XSS).
- Use tools like Burp Suite to test APIs and web interfaces for exploitable issues.

### Gateway Testing

- Analyze gateways for protocol exploits, weak encryption, or improper access control.
- Test edge computing processes for vulnerabilities that attackers could exploit to compromise local processing.
- Simulate attacks on protocol translations (e.g., MQTT or CoAP) to check for unauthorized access or data leakage.

### Exploitation

- Attempt to exploit identified vulnerabilities in devices, communication, interfaces, or cloud services.
- Examples include gaining shell access on a device, bypassing authentication mechanisms, or injecting malicious payloads into APIs.
- Tools like Metasploit or custom scripts are often used in this step.

### Reporting and Remediation

- Document all findings, including identified vulnerabilities, exploitation methods, and their potential impact on the system.
- Provide recommendations for mitigating risks, such as applying patches, enforcing encryption, or improving authentication practices.
Ensure actionable steps for developers and system administrators to fix security gaps.
